# Number-of-unique-words
Hello!
This program receives a text from you at the beginning and then shows you the non-repeated words of the text, and if you enter a space, for example, not available! and a sentence is shown that says there are no words.
But if you enter a word like 'Hello' or repeat it several times, it will show the word and say that there is a non-repeated word in the text.
If you enter a few words, the program shows all non-repeated words and says, for example, there are 7 non-repeated words in the text.
